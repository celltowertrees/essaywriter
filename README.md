Essay Writer, or 'twitteressays'
=============

This began as an attempt to scrape tweets and do weird things with them. Now it's a full-on application for scraping from a selection of sources and applying either a Markov chain to the retrieved words or sorting them by POS. I'm not sure exactly where this is going, but the results never fail to amuse me and my next goal is to get this app deployed somewhere soon so people can try it out online.
